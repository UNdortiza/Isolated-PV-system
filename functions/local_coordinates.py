    # DIRECTION OF BEAM RADIATION

    ## φ (phi) : Latitude, the angular location north or south of the equator, north positive; −90◦ ≤ φ ≤ 90◦.
    ## δ (delta) : Declination, the angular position of the sun at solar noon (i.e., when the sun is on the local meridian) with respect to the plane of the equator, north positive; −23.45◦ ≤ δ ≤ 23.45◦.
    ## β (beta) : Slope, the angle between the plane of the surface in question and the horizontal; 0◦ ≤ β ≤ 180◦. (β > 90◦ means that the surface has a downward-facing component.)
    ## γ (gamma) : Surface azimuth angle, the deviation of the projection on a horizontal plane of the normal to the surface from the local meridian, with zero due south, east negative, and west positive; −180◦ ≤ γ ≤ 180◦.
    ## ω (omega) : Hour angle, the angular displacement of the sun east or west of the local meridian due to rotation of the earth on its axis at 15◦ per hour; morning negative, afternoon positive.
    ## θ (theta) : Angle of incidence, the angle between the beam radiation on a surface and the normal to that surface.
    
    ###  angles that describe the position of the sun in the sky:

    ## θ_z (theta_z) : Zenith angle, the angle between the vertical and the line to the sun, that is, the angle of incidence of beam radiation on a horizontal surface.
    ## α_s (alpha_s) : Solar altitude angle, the angle between the horizontal and the line to the sun, that is, the complement of the zenith angle.
    ## γ_s (gamma_s) : Solar azimuth angle, the angular displacement from south of the projection of beam radiation on the horizontal plane, shown in Figure 1.6.1. Displacements east of south are negative and west of south are positive
